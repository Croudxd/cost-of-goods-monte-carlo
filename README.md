# cost-of-goods-monte-carlo
Monte carlo model for predicting the price of goods from select inputs.

**(Built for my dad)**

## Built using glfw and ImGui.
Both are small enough to be statically linked. so no dependencies other than if your building cmake and a cpp compiler (20+).

### Building on linux.

`mkdir build & cd build`

`cmake ..`

`make -j`

Now built we can run the program :

`./MyApp`
